Every year, we put out a Christmas card for our clients at work. It's usually a message wishing them a happy holiday season, but for 2023 we decided to do something a bit more creative.

Santa Dash is a simple pixel game built in canvas where the user collects coins and gifts to increase their score. Creating sprite sheets and working out the collision detection made this a really fun little project in my downtime.

We're hoping to reskin for the upcoming year and add a leaderboard. In the meantime, I'd [love to hear](mailto:hello@joannahosking.com) your highscore!
